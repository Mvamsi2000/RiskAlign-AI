# RiskAlign-AI

RiskAlign-AI is an **AI-driven Cybersecurity Decision Intelligence platform** designed to transform vulnerability data into business-aligned insights. It combines vulnerability scoring, compliance mapping, and explainable narratives into a single, modular system. Built with **FastAPI, React, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, RiskAlign-AI helps security teams prioritize what matters most, communicate effectively with all stakeholders, and integrate seamlessly with the growing AI ecosystem.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Risk-to-Cost Optimizer**: Generates remediation plans that balance risk reduction with time and resource constraints.
- **Compliance Mapper**: Automatically maps findings (CVEs, vulnerabilities) to industry frameworks like NIST, ISO, and CIS.
- **Explainable Narratives**: Converts technical findings into plain-language explanations tailored for engineers, CISOs, and board members.
- **Business Impact Scoring**: Estimates financial risk ($) and compliance improvement (%) for every decision.
- **Executive Summary Generator**: Produces auto-generated one-page reports for leadership.
- **Adaptive Prioritization**: Learns from analyst feedback to adjust weights and rules over time.
- **Natural-Language Risk Queries**: Ask questions like *"What should we fix this week for maximum compliance gain?"* and get actionable answers.
- **Explainability Heatmaps**: Transparent scoring breakdowns showing how each component (CVSS, EPSS, KEV, context, rules) contributes to final risk.
- **MCP Integration**: All features are exposed as MCP tools, enabling interoperability with AI copilots and external systems.
